# School_District_Analysis
Utilizing Python Pandas to analyze data
## Overview: Background and Purpose
### Background
In this analysis, we are working alongside Maria - data scientist for city school district - to prepare a report of analysis on standardized testing data to adress performance patterns among the students and find any trends with relation to funding. While building this report, evidence of academic dishonesty was found in relation to the the Thomas High School's ningth graders reading and math scores.
### Purpose
The goal of this analysis is to identify whether the omission of the Thomas High School ninth grade scores has an effect on the overall analysis. 

## Results
How is the district summary affected?
- First let us look at the result of the initial district analysis:

![Initial distric analysis results](https://github.com/chichi-ugo/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/images/district_analysis_df_init.PNG?raw=true)
  
- Now, we can compare these results the the table that we get after changingthe data to reflect the THS (Thomas High School) ninth grade test score ommission:
  
![District analysis after THS ommission](https://github.com/chichi-ugo/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/images/district_analysis_df_post.PNG?raw=true)

- We see that in both the averages of the test scores in both subjects, and in the passing passing percentages of both subjecs and overall that taking out the compromised scores has decreased these values. 
   
   
How is the school summary affected?
- Like above, we will look first at the initial analysis before removing the compromised data - spicifally at the row for THS:

- Next we look at the results post-ommitting compromised data:

![School summary after ommission](https://github.com/chichi-ugo/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/images/school_analysis_df_post.PNG?raw=true)

- In this data, we have adjusted the total number of students for THS to look only at the 10th-12th graders and their scores. Again, we see in these results that both the values for the average test scores and the percentages for passing rates have decreased after we removed the compromised test data.

  
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

 
 
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
![]()
  - Scores by school spending
![]()
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type
